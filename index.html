                <h1>Missile Man of India</h2>
                    <br>
                <p><b>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</b>, often called the Missile Man of India, was a distinguished scientist, educator, and the 11th President of India, born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. His contributions to India's defense and space technology, including the development of indigenous missiles and the successful launch of the satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III), marked him as a visionary leader. Beyond his technical acumen, Kalam was known for his humility, warmth, and ability to inspire youth with his speeches and writings, emphasizing the importance of dreaming big and working hard. Serving as President from 2002 to 2007, he championed education and societal development, advocating for inclusive growth and innovation. His autobiography, "Wings of Fire," narrates his journey from humble beginnings to national prominence, reflecting his vision for a prosperous and empowered India. Even after his presidency, Kalam continued to be an influential advocate for science, education, and societal progress until his passing on July 27, 2015. His legacy endures as a symbol of integrity, perseverance, and the transformative potential of education and innovation.</p>
